## AI Study
The team recognises the inherent mismatch between diverse learning styles and the limitations of traditional, lecture-based teaching methods. This mismatch, as outlined in the problem statement, can prevent the student from having a successful higher education experience.

Hence, the team proposes AIStudy with the aim to directly address the mismatch between traditional teaching methods and student learning needs.

The objectives of AIStudy are:

- Provide tools that directly address the needs of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners, promoting inclusivity in learning.

- Have interactive and dynamic features as it will create a more engaging environment, promoting deeper understanding and critical thinking.

- Help students recognise their strengths and overcome learning challenges, fostering a sense of confidence and achievement instead of the misattribution of difficulty often caused by a mismatch in learning and teaching styles.

To achieve these objectives, AIStudy features visual note capture and AR visualisation for visual learners, text-to-speech for auditory learners, and an AI-powered chatbot for interactive discussions, catering to those who prefer dialogue-based learning. Additionally, the app empowers flexible note-taking in the form of pictures, text, and audio, suiting various information processing methods. Overall, AIStudy aims to close gaps in traditional education by providing a tool that adapts to individual learning preferences, aspiring to assist students in engaging their studies more effectively and efficiently.
